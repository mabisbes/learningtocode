# learningtocode
This repository is basically a portfolio, showcasing how my skills evolved from when I first started learning python (march of 2022) to the middle of july of the same year. It includes some of my favorite projects from my university's python class
Please note that this repository does not reflect my current python skills, as it is just a way to see how much I've evolved in such a short time span
